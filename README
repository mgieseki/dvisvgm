dvisvgm -- A DVI to SVG converter

DESCRIPTION

 dvisvgm is a utility for TeX/LaTeX users. It converts
 DVI files to the XML-based Scalable Vector Graphics format.


DEPENDENCIES

 dvisvgm relies on the following free libraries:
   * FreeType 2 (http://www.freetype.org)
     This library is used to extract glyph outlines
     from PFB files.

   * kpathsea
     This library is part of the Web2C package and is
     usually installed in conjunction with a TeX distribution.
     kpathsea provides functions for searching files in the
     large texmf tree.

   * potracelib (http://potrace.sourceforge.net)
     Peter Selinger's bitmap tracing library is utilized to
     vectorize Metafont's bitmap output.
	  potracelib is now part of the dvisvgm source tarball, so
	  you don't need to create the library seperately any longer.

   * zlib (http://www.zlib.org)
     Compressed SVG files are produced by using functions
     of this library and the Gzstream wrapper classes
     (http://www.cs.unc.edu/Research/compgeom/gzstream)
     which should be included with this package.


COMPILATION

 Quick installation info:
   * type "./configure"
   * type "make"
   * type "make install" as root (or "sudo make install")

 For generic configuration instructions see the file INSTALL.

 The configure script should recognize all necessary parameters.
 If a library is installed but not detected, specify its location
 as commandline parameter of configure, e.g.
   ./configure --with-freetype=/usr/local/freetype
 (all available options can be displayed with ./configure --help)

 The tracer module calls Metafont in case of lacking TFM or PFB files
 via a system call. Please ensure that Metafont is installed and
 reachable over the search path.
 
 To build Windows binaries I recommend MinGW in conjunction
 with MSYS (http://www.mingw.org). If executed within MSYS
 the configure script assumes that you want to build dvisvgm
 for MiKTeX. In this case the necessary import libraries for
 the MiKTeX DLLs will be created and linked. If not already done,
 add the MiKTeX bin directory to your search path, otherwise the
 required DLLs won't be found while running dvisvgm.

 If you don't like compiling the sources yourself, you can
 download precompiled executables for Windows and MiKTeX
 from sourceforge.net instead (see below).


USAGE
 Information about the command-line interface and the available options
 can be found in the manual page.


ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
 This packacke is available from CTAN (dviware/dvisvgm) and can
 be downloaded from the project website at sourceforge.net as well:

    http://dvisvgm.sourceforge.net

 Here you can find the sources, precompiled binaries and further additional
 information about the converter and related topics.

 If you've found a bug please let me know. You can either send me an
 email or preferably use the bug reporting facilities at sourceforge.net
 (see http://sourceforge.net/projects/dvisvgm).
