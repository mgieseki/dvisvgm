NAME
----
dvisvgm - converts DVI and EPS files to the XML-based SVG format


SYNOPSIS
--------
*dvisvgm* [ 'options' ] 'file' [.dvi]

*dvisvgm* -E [ 'options' ] 'file' [.eps]


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The command-line utility *dvisvgm* converts DVI files, as generated by TeX/LaTeX, to the
XML-based scalable vector graphics format SVG. It supports the classic DVI format 2 as
well as format 3 (created by pTeX in vertical mode), and the XeTeX formats 5 and 6 which are
also known as XDV. Besides the basic DVI commands, dvisvgm also evaluates many so-called
'specials' which heavily extend the capabilities of the plain DVI format. For a more detailed
overview, see section <<specials,*Supported Specials*>> below.

Since the current SVG standard 1.1 doesn't specify multi-page graphics, dvisvgm creates
separate SVG files for each DVI page. Because of compatibility reasons, only the first page
is converted by default. In order to select a different page or arbitrary page sequences,
use option *-p* which is described below.

SVG is a vector-based graphics format and therefore dvisvgm tries to convert the glyph outlines
of all fonts referenced in a DVI page section to scalable path descriptions. The fastest way
to achieve this is to extract the path information from vector-based font files available in
PFB, TTF, or OTF format. If dvisvgm is able to find such a file, it extracts all necessary
outline information about the glyphs from it.

However, TeX's main source for font descriptions is Metafont, which produces bitmap output
(GF files). That's why not all obtainable TeX fonts are available in a scalable format.
In these cases, dvisvgm tries to vectorize Metafont's output by tracing the glyph bitmaps.
The results are not as perfect as most (manually optimized) PFB or OTF counterparts, but are
nonetheless really nice in most cases.

When running dvisvgm without option *--no-fonts*, it creates 'font' elements (+<font>+...+</font>+)
to embed the font data into the SVG files. Unfortunately, only few SVG renderes support these
elements yet. Most web browsers and vector graphics applications don't evaluate them properly so
that the text components of the resulting graphics might look strange. In order to create more
compatible SVG files, command-line option *--no-fonts* can be given to replace the font elements
by plain graphics paths.


OPTIONS
-------
*-a, --trace-all*=['retrace']::
This option forces dvisvgm to vectorize not only the glyphs actually required to render the
SVG file correctly – which is the default –, but processes all glyphs of all fonts referenced in
the DVI file. Because dvisvgm stores the tracing results a font cache, all following conversions these
fonts will speed up significantly.
The boolean option 'retrace' determines how to handle glyphs already stored in the cache.
By default, these glyphs are skipped. Setting argument 'retrace' to 'yes' or 'true' forces dvisvgm
to retrace the corresponding bitmaps again.
+
[NOTE]
This option only takes effect if font caching is active. Therefore, *--trace-all* cannot be
combined with option *--cache=none*.
+


*-b, --bbox*='fmt'::
Sets the bounding box of the generated graphic to the specified format. The parameter 'fmt'
takes either one of the format specifiers listed below, or a sequence of four comma- or
whitespace-separated length values 'x1', 'y1', 'x2' and 'y2'. The latter define the absolute
coordinates of two diagonal corners of the bounding box. Each length value consists of a floating
point number and an optional length unit (pt, bp, cm, mm, in, or pc). If the unit is omitted,
TeX points (pt) are assumed.
+
It's also possible to give only one length value 'l'. In this case, the minimal bounding box
is computed and enlarged by adding (-'l',-'l') to the upper left and ('l','l') to the lower
right corner.
+
Additionally, dvisvgm also supports the following format specifiers:
 
 *International DIN/ISO paper sizes*;;
 A__n__, B__n__, C__n__, D__n__, where 'n' is a non-negative integer, e.g. A4 or a4 for DIN/ISO A4
 format (210mm &#215; 297mm).
 
 *North American paper sizes*;;
   invoice, executive, legal, letter, ledger
 
 *Special bounding box sizes*;;
[horizontal]
   *dvi*::: page size stored in the DVI file
   *min*::: computes the minimal/tightest bounding box
   *none*::: no bounding box is assigned
	*preview*::: bounding box data computed by the preview package (if present in the dvi file)
//
 *Page orientation*;;
   The default page orientation for DIN/ISO and American paper sizes is 'portrait',
   i.e. 'width' < 'height'. Appending *-landscape* or simply *-l* to the format
   string switches to 'landscape' mode ('width' > 'height'). For symmetry reasons you can
   also explicitly add *-portrait* or *-p* to indicate the default portrait format.
   Note that these suffixes are part of the size string and not separate options. Thus,
   they must directly follow the size specifier without additional blanks.
   Furthermore, the orientation suffixes can't be used with *dvi*, *min*, and *none*.
+
[NOTE]
Option *-b, --bbox* only affects the bounding box and does not transform the page content.
Hence, if you choose a landscape format, the page won't be rotated.
+
//

//
*-C, --cache*[='dir']::
To speed up the conversion process of bitmap fonts, dvisvgm saves intermediate conversion
information in cache files. By default, these files are stored in +$HOME/.dvisvgm/cache+.
If you prefer a different location, use option *--cache* to overwrite the default. Furthermore,
it is also possible to disable the font caching mechanism completely with option *--cache=none*.
If argument 'dir' is omitted, dvisvgm prints the path of the default cache directory together
with further information about the stored fonts. Additionally, outdated and corrupted cache files
are removed.


*-j, --clipjoin*::
This option tells dvisvgm to compute all intersections of clipping paths itself rather than
delegating this task to the SVG renderer. The resulting SVG files are more portable because
some SVG viewers don't support intersecting clipping paths which are defined by 'clipPath'
elements containing a 'clip-path' attribute.


*--color*::
Enables colorization of messages printed during the conversion process. The colors can be
customized via the environment variable *DVISVGM_COLORS*. See the <<environment, Environment section>>
below for further information.


*--colornames*::
By default, dvisvgm exclusively uses RGB values of the form '#RRGGBB' to represent colors in
the SVG file. According to the SVG standard, it's also possible to use color names (like +black+
and +darkblue+) for a limited number of predefined colors. In order to apply these color names
rather than their RGB values, call dvisvgm with option *--colornames*. All colors without an
SVG color name will still be represented by RGB values.


*-E, --eps*::
If this option is given, dvisvgm does not expect a DVI but an EPS input file, and tries to convert
it to SVG. In order to do so, a single 'psfile' special command is created and forwarded to the
PostScript special handler.
This option is only available if dvisvgm was built with PostScript support enabled, and requires
Ghostscript to be available. See option *--libgs* for further information.


*-e, --exact*::
This option tells dvisvgm to compute the precise bounding box of each character. By default,
the values stored in a font's TFM file are used to determine a glyph's extent. As these values are
intended to implement optimal character placements and are not designed to represent the exact
dimensions, they don't necessarily correspond with the bounds of the visual glyphs. Thus, width
and/or height of some glyphs may be larger (or smaller) than the respective TFM values. As a result,
this can lead to clipped characters at the bounds of the SVG graphics. With option *--exact* given,
dvisvgm analyzes the actual shape of each character and derives a usually tight bounding box.


*-m, --fontmap*='filenames'::
Loads and evaluates a single font map file or a sequence of font map files. These files are required
to resolve font file names and encodings. dvisvgm does not provide its own map files but tries to read
available ones coming with dvips or dvipdfm. If option *--fontmap* is omitted, dvisvgm looks for the
default map files 'ps2pk.map', 'dvipdfm.map', and 'psfonts.map' (in this order). Otherwise, the
files as option arguments are evaluated in the given order. Multiple filenames must be separated by
commas without leading and/or trailing whitespace.
By default, redefined mappings do not replace previous ones. However, each filename can be preceded by
an optional mode specifier (*+*, *-*, or *=*) to change this behavior:
 
  +mapfile;;
    Only those entries in the given map file that don't redefine a font mapping are applied, i.e.
	 fonts already mapped keep untouched. That's also the default mode if no mode specifier is given.
  
  -mapfile;;
    Ensures that none of the font mappings defined in the given map file are used, i.e. previously
    defined mappings for the specified fonts are removed.
  
  =mapfile;;
    All mappings defined in the map file are applied. Previously defined settings for the same fonts
    are replaced.
+
If the first filename in the filename sequence is preceded by a mode specifier, dvisvgm loads the
default font map (see above) and applies the other map files afterwards. Otherwise, none of default
map files will be loaded automatically.
+
Examples: +--fontmap=myfile1.map,+myfile2.map+ loads 'myfile1.map' followed by 'myfile2.map' where all
redefinitions of `myfile2.map` are ignored.
+--fontmap==myfile1.map,-myfile2.map+ loads the default map file followed by 'myfile1.map' and 'myfile2.map'
where all redefinitions of 'myfile1.map' replace previous entries. Afterwards, all definitions for the fonts
given in 'myfile2.map' are removed from the font map tree.
+
For further information about the map file formats and the mode specifiers, see the manuals of
dvips and dvipdfm.


*--grad-overlap*::
Tells dvisvgm to create overlapping grid segments when approximating color gradient fills (also see
option *--grad-segments* below). By default, adjacent segments don't overlap but only touch each other
like separate tiles. However, this alignment can lead to visible gaps between the segments
because the background color usually influences the color at the boundary of the segments if the
SVG renderer uses anti-aliasing to create smooth contours.
One way to avoid this and to create seamlessly touching color regions is to enlarge the segments so
that they extent into the area of their right and bottom neighbors. Since the latter are drawn on top
of the overlapping parts, the visible size of all segments keeps unchanged. Just the former gaps
disappear as the background is now completely covered by the correct colors.
Currently, dvisvgm computes the overlapping segments separately for each patch of the mesh (a patch mesh
may consist of multiple patches of the same type). Therefore, there still might be visible gaps
at the seam of two adjacent patches.


*--grad-segments*='number'::
Determines the maximal number of segments per column and row used to approximate gradient color fills.
Since SVG 1.1 only supports a small subset of the shading algorithms available in PostScript,
dvisvgm approximates some of them by subdividing the area to be filled into smaller, monochromatic
segments. Each of these segments gets the average color of the region it covers. Thus, increasing the
number of segments leads to smaller monochromatic areas and therefore a better approximation of the
actual color gradient. As a drawback, more segments imply bigger SVG files because every segment is
represented by a separate path element.
+
Currently, dvisvgm supports free- and lattice-form triangular patch meshes as well as Coons and
tensor-product patch meshes. They are approximated by subdividing the area of each patch into a
__n__&#215;__n__ grid of smaller segments. The maximal number of segments per column and row can be
changed with option *--grad-segments*.


*--grad-simplify*='delta'::
If the size of the segments created to approximate gradient color fills falls below the given delta
value, dvisvgm reduces their level of detail. For example, Bézier curves are replaced by straight
lines, and triangular segments are combined to tetragons. For a small 'delta', these simplifications
are usually not noticeable but reduce the size of the generated SVG files significantly.


*-h, --help*[='mode']::
Prints a short summary of all available command-line options. The optional 'mode' parameter is
an integer value between 0 and 2. It selects the display variant of the help text. Mode 0
lists all options divided into categories with section headers. This is also the default if
dvisvgm is called without parameters. Mode 1 lists all options ordered by the short option names,
while mode 2 sorts the lines by the long option names.


*--keep*::
Disables the removal of temporary files as created by Metafont (usually .gf, .tfm, and .log files).


*--libgs*='filename'::
This option is only available if the Ghostscript library is not directly linked to dvisvgm and if
PostScript support was not completely disabled during compilation. In this case, dvisvgm tries
to load the shared GS library dynamically during runtime. By default, it expects the library's name
to be +libgs.so.X+ (on Unix-like systems, where +X+ is the ABI version of the library) or
+gsdll32.dll+/+gsdll64.dll+ (Windows). Option *--libgs* can be used to give a different name.
Alternatively, it's also possible to set the GS library name by the environment variable *LIBGS*.
The latter has less precedence than the command-line option, i.e. dvisvgm ignores variable *LIBGS*
if *--libgs* is given.


*-L, --linkmark*='style'::
Selects the method how to mark hyperlinked areas. The 'style' argument can take one of the values
'none', 'box', and 'line', where 'box' is the default, i.e. a rectangle is drawn around
the linked region if option *--linkmark* is omitted. Style argument 'line' just draws the lower edge of
the bounding rectangle, and 'none' tells dvisvgm not to add any visible objects to hyperlinks.
The lines and boxes get the current text color selected. In order to apply a different, constant color,
a colon followed by a color specifier can be appended to the style string. A 'color specifier' is either
a hexadecimal RGB value of the form '#RRGGBB', or a
http://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Colors#The_68_standard_colors_known_to_dvips[dvips color name].
+
Moreover, argument 'style' can take a single color specifier to highlight the linked region by
a frameless box filled with that color. An optional second color specifier separated by a colon
selects the frame color.
+
Examples: +box:red+ or +box:#ff0000+ draws red boxes around the linked areas. +yellow:blue+ creates
yellow filled rectangles with blue frames.


*-l, --list-specials*::
Prints a list of registered special handlers and exits. Each handler processes a set of special
statements belonging to the same category. In most cases, the categories are identified by the
prefix of the special statements. It's usually a leading word separated from the rest of the
statement by a colon or a blank, e.g. 'color' or 'ps'.


*-M, --mag*='factor'::
Sets the magnification factor applied in conjunction with Metafont calls prior tracing the glyphs.
The larger this value, the better the tracing results. Nevertheless, large magnification values
can cause Metafont arithmetic errors due to number overflows. So, use this option with care.
The default setting usually produces nice results.


*--no-merge*::
Puts every single character in a separate 'text' element with corresponding 'x' and 'y' attributes.
By default, new 'text' or 'tspan' elements are only created if a string starts at a location that
differs from the regular position defined by the characters' advance values.


*--no-mktexmf*::
Suppresses the generation of missing font files. If dvisvgm can't find a font file
through the kpathsea lookup mechanism, it calls the external tools 'mktextfm' or 'mktexmf'.
This option disables these calls.


*-n, --no-fonts*[='variant']::
If this option is given, dvisvgm doesn't create SVG 'font' elements but uses 'paths' instead. The
resulting SVG files tend to be larger but they are concurrently more compatible with most applications that
don't support SVG fonts yet. The optional argument 'variant' selects the method how to substitute fonts
by paths. Variant 0 creates 'path' and 'use' elements in order to avoid lengthy duplicates.
Variant 1 creates 'path' elements only.
Option *--no-fonts* implies *--no-styles*.


*-c, --scale*='sx'[,'sy']::
Scales the page content horizontally by 'sx' and vertically by 'sy'. This option is equivalent
to *-TS*'sx','sy'.


*-S, --no-specials*[='names']::
Disable processing of special commands embedded in the DVI file. If no further
parameter is given, all specials are ignored. To disable a selected set of specials,
an optional comma-separated list of names can be appended to this option. A 'name' is the unique
identifier referencing the intended special handler. Option *--list-specials* lists all handlers 
currently available together with their names.
All unsupported special statements are silently ignored.


*--no-styles*::
By default, dvisvgm creates CSS styles and class attributes to reference fonts. This variant is
more compact than adding the complete font information to each text element over and over again.
However, if you prefer direct font references, the default behavior can be disabled with
option *--no-styles*.


*-o, --output*='pattern'::
Sets the pattern specifying the names of the generated SVG files. Parameter 'pattern' is
a string that may contain static character sequences as well as the variables *%f*, *%p*,
and *%P*. *%f* expands to the base name of the DVI file, i.e. the filename without suffix,
*%p* is the current page number, and *%P* the total number of pages in the DVI file. An
optional number (0-9) given directly after the percent sign specifies the minimal number
of digits to be written. If a particular value consists of less digits, the number is
padded with leading zeros.
Example: +%3p+ enforces 3 digits for the current page number (001, 002, etc.).
Without an explicit width specifier, *%p* gets the same number of digits as *%P*.
+
If you need more control over the numbering, you can use arithmetic expressions as part of
a pattern. The syntax is *%(expr)* where 'expr' may contain additions, subtractions,
multiplications, and integer divisions with common precedence. The variables
*p* and *P* contain the current page number and the total number of pages, respectively.
For example, +--output="%f-%(p-1)"+ creates filenames where the numbering starts with 0 rather
than 1.
+
The default pattern is +%f-%p.svg+ if the DVI file consists of more than one page, and
*%f.svg* otherwise. That means, a DVI file 'foo.dvi' is converted to 'foo.svg' if 'foo.dvi'
is a single-page document. Otherwise, multiple SVG files 'foo-01.svg', 'foo-02.svg', etc. are
produced. In Windows environments, the percent sign indicates dereferenced environment
variables, and must therefore be protected by a second percent sign, e.g. +--output=%%f-%%p+.


*-p, --page*='ranges'::
This option selects the pages to be processed. Parameter 'ranges' consists of a comma-separated
list of single page numbers and/or page ranges. A page range is a pair of numbers separated by
a hyphen, e.g. 5-12. Thus, a page sequence might look like this: 2-4,6,9-12,15. It doesn't matter
if a page is given more than once or if page ranges overlap. dvisvgm always extracts the page
numbers in ascending order and converts them only once.
In order to stay compatible with previous versions, the default page sequence is 1. dvisvgm
therefore converts only the first page and not the whole document if option *--page* is omitted.
Usually, page ranges consist of two numbers denoting the first and last page to be converted.
If the conversion should start at page 1, or if it should continue up to the last DVI page, the
first or second range number can be omitted, respectively. Example: +--page=-10+ converts all
pages up to page 10, +--page=10-+ converts all pages starting with page 10.
Please consider that the page values don't refer to the page numbers printed on the
corresponding page. Instead, the physical page count is expected, where the first page always
gets number 1.


*-d, --precision*='digits'::
Specifies the maximal number of decimal places applied to floating-point attribute values.
All attribute values written to the generated SVG file(s) are rounded accordingly. The
parameter 'digits' allows integer values from 0 to 6, where 0 enables the automatic selection
of significant decimal places. This is also the default value if dvisvgm is called without
option *--precision*.


*-P, --progress*[='delay']::
Enables a simple progress indicator shown when time-consuming operations like
PostScript specials are processed. The indicator doesn't appear before the given
delay (in seconds) has elapsed. The default delay value is 0.5 seconds.


*-r, --rotate*='angle'::
Rotates the page content clockwise by 'angle' degrees around the page center.
This option is equivalent to *-TR*'angle'.


*-R, --relative*::
SVG allows to define graphics paths by a sequence of absolute and/or relative path commands,
i.e. each command expects either absolute coordinates or coordinates relative to the
current drawing position. By default, dvisvgm creates paths made up of absolute commands.
If option *--relative* is given, relative commands are created instead. This slightly reduces
the size of the SVG files in most cases.


*-s, --stdout*::
Don't write the SVG output to a file but redirect it to *stdout*.


*-T, --transform*='commands'::
Applies a sequence of transformations to the SVG content. Each transformation is described
by a 'command' beginning with a capital letter followed by a list of comma-separated
parameters. Following transformation commands are supported:
 
  *T* 'tx'[,'ty'];;
    Translates (moves/shifts) the page in direction of vector ('tx','ty'). If 'ty' is omitted,
    'ty'=0 is assumed.
    The expected unit length of 'tx' and 'ty' are TeX points (1pt = 1/72.27in). However, there
    are several constants defined to simplify the unit conversion (see below).
  
  *S* 'sx'[,'sy'];;
    Scales the page horizontally by 'sx' and vertically by 'sy'. If 'sy' is omitted,
    'sy'='sx' is assumed.
  
  *R* 'angle'[,'x','y'];;
    Rotates the page clockwise by 'angle' degrees around point ('x','y'). If the optional
    arguments 'x' and 'y' are omitted, the page will be rotated around its center depending on
    the chosen page format. When option *-bnone* is given, the rotation center is origin (0,0).
  
  *KX* 'angle';;
    Skews the page along the 'x'-axis by 'angle' degrees. Argument 'angle' can take any value
    except 90+180__k__, where 'k' is an integer.
  
  *KY* 'angle';;
    Skews the page along the 'y'-axis by 'angle' degrees. Argument 'angle' can take any value
    except 90+180__k__, where 'k' is an integer.
  
  *FH* ['y'];;
  Mirrors (flips) the page at the horizontal line through point (0,'y'). Omitting the optional argument
  leads to 'y'='h'/2, where 'h' denotes the page height (see <<constants,'pre-defined constants'>> below).
  
  *FV* ['x'];;
  Mirrors (flips) the page at the vertical line through point ('x',0). Omitting the optional argument
  leads to 'x'='w'/2, where 'w' denotes the page width (see <<constants,'pre-defined constants'>> below).
  
  *M* 'm1',...,'m6';;
  Applies a transformation described by the 3&#215;3 matrix
  \(('m1','m2','m3'),('m4','m5','m6'),(0,0,1)), where the inner triples denote
  the rows.
+
[NOTE]
=================================================================================================
All transformation commands of option *-T, --transform* are applied in the order of their appearance.
Multiple commands can optionally be separated by spaces. In this case the whole transformation string
has to be enclosed in double quotes to keep them together. All parameters are expressions of floating
point type. You can either give plain numbers or arithmetic terms combined by the operators *+* (addition),
*-* (subtraction), *** (multiplication), */* (division) or *%* (modulo) with common associativity and
precedence rules. Parentheses may be used as well.

[[constants]]
Additionally, some pre-defined constants are provided:

[horizontal]
*ux*:: horizontal position of upper left page corner in TeX point units
*uy*:: vertical position of upper left page corner in TeX point units
*h*:: page height in TeX point units (0 in case of *-bnone*)
*w*:: page width in TeX point units (0 in case of *-bnone*)

Furthermore, you can use the length constants *pt*, *mm*, *cm* and *in*, e.g.
+2cm+ or +1.6in+. Thus, option +-TT1in,0R45+ moves the page content 1 inch to the right and rotates it
by 45 degrees around the page center afterwards.

For single transformations, there are also the short-hand options *-c*, *-t* and *-r* available.
In contrast to the *--transform** commands, the order of these options is not significant, so
that it's not possible to describe transformation sequences with them.

=================================================================================================
+
//

//
*-t, --translate*='tx'[,'ty']::
Translates (moves) the page content in direction of vector ('tx','ty'). This option is
equivalent to *-TT*'tx','ty'.


*-v, --verbosity*='level'::
Controls the type of messages printed during a dvisvgm run:
[horizontal]
  *0*;; no message output at all
  *1*;; error messages only
  *2*;; warning messages only
  *4*;; informational messages only

+
[NOTE]
By adding these values you can combine the categories. The default level is 7, i.e. all
messages are printed.
+


*-V, --version*[='extended']::
Prints the version of dvisvgm and exits. If the optional argument is set to 'yes', the
version numbers of the linked libraries are printed as well.


*-z, --zip*[='level']::
Creates a compressed SVG file with suffix .svgz. The optional argument specifies the compression
level. Valid values are in the range of 1 to 9 (default value is 9). Larger values cause better
compression results but may take slightly more computation time.
+
CAUTION: This option cannot be combined with *-s, --stdout*.


*-Z, --zoom*[='factor']::
Multiplies the 'width' and 'height' attributes of the SVG root element by argument 'factor' while
the coordinate system of the graphic content is retained. As a result, most SVG viewers zoom the
graphics accordingly. If a negative zoom factor is given, the 'width' and 'height' attributes are omitted.


[[specials]]
SUPPORTED SPECIALS
------------------
dvisvgm supports several sets of 'special commands' that can be used to enrich DVI files with additional
features, like color, graphics, and hyperlinks. The evaluation of special commands is delegated to dedicated
handlers provided by dvisvgm. Each handler is responsible for all special statements of the same command set,
i.e. commands beginning with the same prefix. To get a list of the actually provided special handlers, use
option *--list-specials* (see above). This section gives an overview of the special commands currently
supported.

*bgcolor*::
Special statement for changing the background/page color. Since SVG 1.1 doesn't support background colors,
dvisvgm inserts a rectangle of the chosen color into the generated SVG document. This rectangle always gets
the same size as the selected or computed bounding box. This background color command is part of the color
special set but is handled separately in order to let the user turn it off. For an overview of the command
syntax, see the documentation of dvips, for instance.

*color*::
Statements of this command set provide instructions to change the text/paint color. For an overview of the
exact syntax, see the documentation of dvips, for instance.

*dvisvgm*::
dvisvgm offers its own small set of specials. The following list gives a brief overview.
  *dvisvgm:raw* 'text';;
  Adds an arbitrary sequence of characters to the page section of the SVG document. dvisvgm does not perform
  any validation here, thus the user has to ensure that the resulting SVG is still valid. Parameter 'text'
  may contain the expressions *{?x}*, *{?y}*, and *{?color}* that expand to the current 'x' or 'y' coordinate
  and the current color, respectively. Furthermore, *{?nl}* expands to a newline character.
 
  *dvisvgm:rawdef* 'text';;
  This command is similar to *dvisvgm:raw*, but puts the raw text into the <defs> section of the SVG document
  currently being generated.

  *dvisvgm:rawset* 'name' ... *dvisvgm:endrawset*;;
  This pair of specials marks the begin and end of a definition of a named raw SVG fragment. All *dvisvgm:raw*
  and *dvisvgm:rawdef* specials enclosed by *dvisvgm:rawset* and *dvisvgm:endrawset* are not evaluated
  immediately but jointly stored under the given 'name' for later use. Once defined, the named fragment can be
  referenced throughout the DVI file by *dvisvgm:rawput* (see below).
  The two commands *dvisvgm:rawset* and *dvisvgm:endrawset* must not be nested, i.e. each call of *dvisvgm:rawset*
  has to be followed by a corresponding call of *dvisvgm:endrawset* before another *dvisvgm:rawset* may occur.
  Also, the identifier 'name' must be unique throughout the DVI file. Using *dvisvgm:rawset* multiple times
  together with the same 'name' leads to warning messages.

  *dvisvgm:rawput* 'name';;
  Inserts raw SVG fragments previously stored under the given 'name'. dvisvgm distinguishes between fragments
  that were specified with *dvisvgm:raw* or *dvisvgm:rawdef*, and handles them differently: It inserts all
  *dvisvgm:raw* parts every time *dvisvgm:rawput* is called, whereas the *dvisvgm:rawdef* portions go to the
  <defs> section of the current SVG document only once.

  *dvisvgm:img* 'width' 'height' 'file';;
  Creates an image element at the current graphic position referencing the given file. JPEG, PNG, and SVG images
  can be used here. However, dvisvgm does not check the file format or the file name suffix. The lengths 'width'
  and 'height' must be given as plain floating point numbers in TeX point units (1in = 72.27pt).
 
  *dvisvgm:bbox* n[ew] 'name';;
  Defines or resets a local bounding box called 'name'. The name may consist of letters and digits.
  While processing a DVI page, dvisvgm continuously updates the (global) bounding box of the current page in order to
  determine the minimal rectangle containing all visible page components (characters, images, drawing elements etc.)
  Additionally to the global bounding box, the user can request an arbitrary number of named local bounding boxes.
  Once defined, these boxes are updated together with the global bounding box starting with the first character that
  follows the definition. Thus, the local boxes can be used to compute the extent of parts of the page. This is useful
  for scenarios where the generated SVG file is post-processed.
  In conjunction with special *dvisvgm:raw*, the macro *{?bbox 'name'}* expands to the four values 'x', 'y', 'w', and 'h'
  (separated by spaces) specifying the coordinates of the upper left corner, width, and height of the local box 'name'.
  If box 'name' wasn't previously defined, all four values equal to zero.
 
  *dvisvgm:bbox* 'width' 'height' ['depth'];;
  Updates the bounding box of the current page by embedding a virtual rectangle ('x', 'y', 'width', 'height')
  where the lower left corner is located at the current DVI drawing position ('x','y'). If the optional parameter 'depth'
  is specified, dvisvgm embeds a second rectangle ('x', 'y', 'width', -__depth__). The lengths 'width', 'height' and
  'depth' must be given as plain floating point numbers in TeX point units (1in = 72.27pt). Depending on size and position
  of the virtual rectangle, this command either enlarges the overall bounding box or leaves it as is. It's not possible
  to reduce its extent. This special should be used in conjunction with *dvisvgm:raw* in order to update the viewport
  of the page properly.
 
  *dvisvgm:bbox* a[bs] 'x1' 'y1' 'x2' 'y2';;
  This variant of the bbox special updates the bounding box by embedding a virtual rectangle ('x1','y1','x2','y2').
  The points ('x1','y1') and ('x2','y2') denote two diagonal corners of the rectangle given in TeX point units.
 
  *dvisvgm:bbox* f[ix] 'x1' 'y1' 'x2' 'y2';;
  This variant of the bbox special assigns an absolute (final) bounding box to the resulting SVG. After executing
  this command, dvisvgm doesn't further alter the bounding box coordinates, except this special is called again later.
  The points ('x1','y1') and ('x2','y2') denote two diagonal corners of the rectangle given in TeX point units.

The following TeX snippet adds two raw SVG elements to the output and updates the bounding box accordingly:

*em*::
These specials were introduced with the emTeX distribution by Eberhard Mattes. They provide line drawing
statements, instructions for embedding MSP, PCX, and BMP image files, as well as two PCL commands.
dvisvgm supports only the line drawing statements and ignores all other em specials silently.
A description of the command syntax can be found in the DVI driver documentation coming with
http://www.ctan.org/pkg/emtex[emTeX].

*html*::
The hyperref specification defines several variants on how to mark hyperlinked areas in a DVI file. dvisvgm
supports the plain HyperTeX special constructs as created with hyperref package option 'hypertex'.
By default, all linked areas of the document are marked by a rectangle. Option *--linkmark* allows to change
this behavior. See above for further details. Information on syntax and semantics of the HyperTeX specials can be
found in the http://www.ctan.org/pkg/hyperref[hyperref manual].

*pdf*::
pdfTeX and dvipdfmx introduced several special commands related to the generation of PDF files. Currently, only
two of them, 'pdf:mapfile' and 'pdf:mapline' are supported by dvisvgm. These specials allow modifying the font map
tree during the processing of DVI files. They are used by CTeX, for example. dvisvgm supports both, the dvips and
dvipdfm font map format. For further information on the command syntax and semantics, see the documentation of
+\pdfmapfile+ in the http://www.ctan.org/pkg/pdftex[pdfTeX user manual].

*ps*::
The famous DVI driver dvips introduced its own set of specials in order to embed PostScript code into DVI files,
which greatly improves the capabilities of DVI documents. One aim of dvisvgm is to completely evaluate all
PostScript snippets and to convert as many of them as possible to SVG. In contrast to dvips, dvisvgm uses
floating point arithmetics to compute the precise position of each graphic element, i.e. it doesn't round the
coordinates. Therefore, the relative locations of the graphic elements may slightly differ from those computed
by dvips.
+
Since PostScript is a rather complex language, dvisvgm does not try to implement its own PostScript interpreter
but relies on http://ghostscript.com[Ghostscript] instead. If the Ghostscript library was not linked to the
dvisvgm binary, it is looked up and loaded dynamically during runtime. In this case, dvisvgm looks for
'libgs.so.X' on Unix-like systems (supported ABI versions: 7,8,9), and for 'gsdll32.dll' or 'gsdll64.dll' on
Windows. You can override the default file names with environment variable *LIBGS* or the command-line
option *--libgs*. The library must be reachable through the ld search path (\*nix) or the PATH environment
variable (Windows). Alternatively, the absolute file path can be specified. If the library cannot be found,
dvisvgm disables the processing of PostScript specials and prints a warning message.
Use option *--list-specials* to check whether PostScript support is available, i.e. entry 'ps' is present.
+
The PostScript handler also recognizes and evaluates bounding box data generated by the
http://www.ctan.org/pkg/preview[preview package] with option 'tightpage'. If such data is present in the DVI file
and if dvisvgm is called with option *--bbox=preview*, dvisvgm adapts the bounding box of the generated SVG file
accordingly, and prints a message showing the width, height, and depth of the box in TeX point units. Especially,
the depth value can be used to vertically align the SVG graphics with the baseline of surrounding text in HTML or
XSL-FO documents, for example. If you call dvisvgm with option *--bbox=min* (the default), the tight bounding box
computed while processing the page is applied and not the one provided by the preview package. Thus, the height,
depth and width values written to the console are adapted accordingly.

*tpic*::
The TPIC special set defines instructions for drawing simple geometric objects. Some LaTeX packages, like
eepic and tplot, use these specials to describe graphics.

[[environment]]
ENVIRONMENT
-----------
dvisvgm uses the *kpathsea* library for locating the files that it opens.
Hence, the environment variables described in the library's documentation influence the converter.

If dvisvgm was linked without the Ghostscript library, and if PostScript support has not been disabled,
the shared Ghostscript library is looked up during runtime via dlopen(). The environment variable *LIBGS*
can be used to specify path and file name of the library.

The pre-compiled Windows versions of dvisvgm require a working installation of MiKTeX 2.9 or above.
dvisvgm does not work together with the portable edition of MiKTeX because it relies on MiKTeX's COM
interface that is only accessible in a local installation.
To enable the evaluation of PostScript specials, the original Ghostscript DLL 'gsdll32.dll' must be present
and reachable through the search path. 64-bit Windows builds require the 64-bit Ghostscript DLL 'gsdll64.dll'.
Both DLLs come with the corresponding Ghostscript installers available from http://ghostscript.com.

The environment variable *DVISVGM_COLORS* specifies the colors used to highlight various parts of dvisvgm's
message output. It is only evaluated if option *--color* is given. The value of *DVISVGM_COLORS* is a list of
colon-separated entries of the form 'gg'='BF', where 'gg' denotes one of the color group indicators listed
below, and 'BF' are two hexadecimal digits specifying the background (first digit) and foreground/text color
(second digit). The color values are defined as follows: 0=black, 1=red, 2=green, 3=yellow, 4=blue,
5=magenta, 6=cyan, 7=gray, 8=bright red, 9=bright green, A=bright yellow, B=bright blue, C=bright magenta,
D=bright cyan, E=bright gray, F=white. Depending on the terminal, the colors may differ. Rather than changing
both the text and background color, it's also possible to change only one of them: An asterisk (*) in
place of a hexadecimal digit indicates the default text or background color of the terminal.

All malformed entries in the list are silently ignored.

[horizontal]
*er*:: error messages
*wn*:: warning messages
*pn*:: messages about page numbers
*ps*:: page size messages
*fw*:: information about the files written
*sm*:: state messages
*tr*:: messages of the glyph tracer
*pi*:: progress indicator

*Example:* +er=01:pi=\*5+ sets the colors of error messages (+er+) to red (+1+) on black (+0+), and those
of progress indicators (+pi+) to cyan (+5+) on default background (+*+).
