NAME
----
dvisvgm - converts DVI files to the XML-based SVG format


SYNOPSIS
--------
*dvisvgm* [ 'options' ] 'file' [.dvi]


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The command-line utility *dvisvgm* converts DVI files, as generated by TeX/LaTeX, to the
XML-based scalable vector graphics format SVG. Since the current SVG standard 1.1 doesn't
specify multi-page graphics, dvisvgm creates separate SVG files for each DVI page.
Because of compatibility reasons, only the first page is converted by default. In order
to select a different page or arbitrary page sequences, use option *-p* which is described below.

dvisvgm should properly convert all pages that are made up of fonts and rules only.
However, the utility also supports a couple of DVI extensions defined in terms of 'DVI specials'.
For a more detailed overview, see section *support of specials* below.

As SVG is a vector based graphics format, dvisvgm tries to convert the glyph
outlines of all used fonts into scalable path descriptions. The fastest way to do that
is to extract the path information from PFB (PostScript Type 1) files. So, if dvisvgm is able
to find a PFB file for a required font, it will read the necessary information from this file.

TeX's main source for font descriptions is Metafont though, which produces bitmap output. That's why
not all obtainable TeX fonts are available in PFB format. In these cases, dvisvgm tries
to vectorize Metafont's output (GF fonts) by tracing the glyph bitmaps. The results are not
as perfect as most (manually optimized) PFB outlines but are nonetheless really nice in most cases.


OPTIONS
-------
*-a, --trace-all*=['retrace']::
This option forces dvisvgm to trace not only the actually needed glyphs but all
glyphs of all bitmap fonts used in the DVI file. Since the tracing results are stored in
the font cache, all following DVI conversions (without option *--trace-all*) where these
fonts are involved, will be much faster. By default, dvisvgm traces only the actually
needed glyphs, and adds them to the cache.
The boolean option 'retrace' determines how to handle glyphs already stored in the cache.
By default, these glyphs are skipped. Setting argument 'retrace' to 'yes' or
'true' forces dvisvgm to trace the corresponding bitmaps again.
+
[NOTE]
This option only takes affect if font caching is active. Thus, *--trace-all* cannot be
combined with option *--cache=none*.
+


*-b, --bbox*='fmt'::
Sets the bounding box of the generated graphic to the specified format. The parameter 'fmt'
takes either one of the format specifiers listed below, or a sequence of four comma- or
whitespace-separated length values 'x1', 'y1', 'x2' and 'y2'. The latter define two diagonal
corners of the bounding box. Each length value consists of a floating point number and an optional
length unit (pt, bp, cm, mm, in, or pc). If the unit is omitted, TeX points (pt) are assumed.
+
It's also possible to give only one length value 'l'. In this case, the minimal bounding box
is computed and enlarged by adding (-'l',-'l') to the upper left and ('l','l') to the lower
right corner.
+
Alternatively, the following format specifiers are supported:
 
 *International DIN/ISO paper sizes*;;
 A__n__, B__n__, C__n__, D__n__, where 'n' is a non-negative integer, e.g. A4 or a4 for DIN/ISO A4
 format (210mm &#215; 297mm).
 
 *North American paper sizes*;;
   invoice, executive, legal, letter, ledger
 
 *Special bounding box sizes*;;
[horizontal]
   *dvi*::: page size stored in the DVI file
   *min*::: computes the minimal/tightest bounding box
   *none*::: no bounding box is assigned

//
 *Page orientation*;;
   The default page orientation for DIN/ISO and American paper sizes is 'portrait',
   i.e. 'width' < 'height'. Appending *-landscape* or simply *-l* to the format
   string switches to 'landscape' mode ('width' > 'height'). For symmetry reasons you can
   also explicitly add *-portrait* or *-p* to indicate the default portrait format.
   Note that these suffixes are part of the size string and not separate options. Thus,
   they must directly follow the size specifier without additional blanks.
   Furthermore, the orientation suffixes can't be used with *dvi*, *min*, and *none*.
+
[NOTE]
Option *-b, --bbox* only affects the bounding box and does not transform the page content.
Hence, if you choose a landscape format, the page won't be rotated.
+
//

//
*-c, --scale*='sx'[,'sy']::
Scales the page content horizontally by 'sx' and vertically by 'sy'. This option is equivalent
to *-TS*'sx','sy'.


*-C, --cache*[='dir']::
To speed up the conversion process of bitmap fonts, dvisvgm saves intermediate conversion
information in cache files. By default, these files are stored in $HOME/.dvisvgm/cache. If you prefer
a different location, use option *--cache* to overwrite the default. Furthermore, it is also possible
to disable the font caching mechanism completely with option *--cache=none*. If argument 'dir' is omitted,
dvisvgm prints the path of the default cache directory and some information about the stored fonts.
Additionally, outdated and corrupted cache files are removed.


*--color*::
Enables colorization of messages printed during the conversion process. The colors can be customized
via the environment variable +DVISVGM_COLORS+. See the ENVIRONMENT section below for further information.


*-e, --exact*::
If this option is given, dvisvgm computes the precise bounding box of each character. By default,
the values stored in a font's TFM file are used to determine a glyph's extent. As these values are
intended to realize optimal character placements and are not designed to represent the exact dimensions,
they don't necessarily correspond with the bounds of the visual glyphs. Thus, width and/or height
of some glyphs may be larger than the respective TFM values. As a result, this can lead to clipped
characters at the bounds of the SVG graphic. With option *--exact*, dvisvgm analyzes the actual shape
of each character and derives a usually tight bounding box.


*-h, --help*::
Prints a short summary of all available command-line options.
This is also the default action if dvisvgm is called without parameters.


*--libgs=filename*::
This option is only available if the Ghostscript library is not directly linked to dvisvgm and if
PostScript support was not completely disabled during compilation. In this case, dvisvgm tries
to load the shared GS library dynamically during runtime. By default, it expects the library's name
to be libgs.so (on Unix-like systems) or gsdll32.dll (Windows). Option *--libgs* can be used to give
a different name. Alternatively, it's also possible to set the GS library name by the environment
variable +LIBGS+. The latter has less precedence than the command-line option.


*-l, --list-specials*::
Prints a list of registered special handlers and exits. Each handler processes a set of special
statements belonging to the same category. In most cases, the categories are identified by the
prefix of the special statements. It's usually a leading word separated from the rest of the
statement by a colon or a blank, e.g. 'color' or 'ps'.


*--keep*::
Disables the removal of temporary files as created by Metafont (usually .gf, .tfm, and .log files).


*-m, --map-file*='file'::
Sets the map file used to look up font names and encodings. dvisvgm does not provide
its own map file but tries to read available ones coming with dvips or dvipdfm. If
option *-m* is not given, dvisvgm looks for +ps2pk.map+, +dvipdfm.map+, and +psfonts.map+ (in this order).
Without further options, the file specified by option *-m* will be used instead of the
default maps. If you want dvisgvm to load the given file additionally to the default maps, add a
leading '+' to the file/path, e.g. `--map-file=+myfonts.map`.
For further information about the map file formats, see the manuals of dvips and dvipdfm.


*-M, --mag*='factor'::
Sets the maginfication factor applied in conjunction with Metafont calls prior tracing the glyphs.
The larger this value, the better the tracing results. Nevertheless, large magnification values
can cause Metafont arithmetic errors due to number overflows. So, use this option with care.
The default setting usually produces nice results.


*-n, --no-fonts*[='variant']::
If this option is given, dvisvgm doesn't create SVG 'font' elements but uses 'paths' instead. The
resulting SVG files tends to be larger but concurrently more compatible with most applications that
don't support SVG fonts yet. The optional argument 'variant' selects the method how to substitute fonts
by paths. Variant 0 creates 'path' and 'use' elements. Variant 1 creates 'path' elements only.
Option *--no-fonts* implies *--no-styles*.


*-S, --no-specials*[='names']::
Disable processing of special commands embedded in the DVI file. If no further
parameter is given, all specials are ignored. To selectively disable sets of specials,
an optional comma-separated list of names can be appended to this option. A 'name' is the unique
identifier referencing the intended special handler. Option *--list-specials* lists all currently
available handlers and their names.
All unsupported special statements are silently ignored.


*--no-styles*::
By default, dvisvgm creates CSS styles and class attributes to reference fonts because it's more
compact than repeatedly set the complete font information in each text element. However, if you
prefer direct font references, the default behavior can be disabled with option *--no-styles*.


*--no-mktexmf*::
Suppresses the generation of missing font files. If dvisvgm can't find a font file
through the kpathsea lookup mechanism, it calls the external tools mktextfm or mktexmf by.
This option disables these calls.


*-o, --output*='pattern'::
Sets the name pattern of the output file. Parameter 'pattern' is a string that may
contain the variables *%f* and *%p*. *%f* stands for the base name of the DVI file, i.e.
the DVI filename without suffix, and *%p* is the current page number.
The default pattern is *%f-%p.svg* if the DVI file consists of more than one page, and
*%f.svg* otherwise. That means, a DVI file 'foo.dvi' is converted to 'foo.svg' if 'foo.dvi'
is a single-page document. Otherwise, multiple SVG files 'foo-01.svg', 'foo-02.svg', etc. are
produced. In Windows environments, the percent sign indicates dereferenced environment
variables, and must therefore be protected by a second percent sign, e.g. *--output=%%f-%%p*.


*-p, --page*='ranges'::
This option sets the pages to be processed. Parameter 'ranges' consists of a comma-separated list
of single page numbers and/or page ranges. A page range is a pair of numbers separated by a hyphen,
e.g. 5-12. Thus, a page sequence might look like this: 2-4,6,9-12,15. It doesn't matter if a page
is given more than once or if page ranges overlap. dvisvgm always extracts the page numbers in
ascending order and converts them only once.
In order to stay compatible with previous versions, the default page sequence is 1. dvisvgm
therefore converts only the first page and not the whole document in case option *--page* is omitted.
Usually, page ranges consist of two numbers denoting the first and last page to be converted.
If the conversion is to be started at page 1, or if it should continue up to the last DVI page, the
first or second range number can be omitted, respectively. Example: *--page=-10* converts all
pages up to page 10, *--page=10-* converts all pages starting with page 10.
Please consider that the page values don't refer to the page numbers printed on the page.
Instead, the physical page count is expected, where the first page always gets number 1.


*-P, --progress*[='delay']::
Enables a simple progress indicator shown when time-consuming operations like
PostScript specials are processed. The indicator doesn't appear before the given
delay (in seconds) has elapsed. The default delay value is 0.5 seconds.


*-r, --rotate*='angle'::
Rotates the page content clockwise by 'angle' degrees around the page center.
This option is equivalent to *-TR*'angle'.


*-s, --stdout*::
Don't write the SVG output to a file but redirect it to *stdout*.


*-t, --translate*='tx'[,'ty']::
Translates (moves) the page content in direction of vector ('tx','ty'). This option is
equivalent to *-TT*'tx','ty'.


*-T, --transform*='commands'::
Applies a sequence of transformations to the SVG content. Each transformation is described
by a 'command' beginning with a capital letter followed by a list of comma-separated
parameters. Following transformation commands are supported:
 
  *T* 'tx'[,'ty'];;
    Translates (moves) the page in direction of vector ('tx','ty'). If 'ty' is omitted,
    'ty'=0 is assumed.
    The expected unit length of 'tx' and 'ty' are TeX points (1pt = 1/72.27in). However, there
    are several constants defined to simplify the unit conversion (see below).
  
  *S* 'sx'[,'sy'];;
    Scales the page horizontally by 'sx' and vertically by 'sy'. If 'sy' is omitted,
    'sy'='sx' is assumed.
  
  *R* 'angle'[,'x','y'];;
    Rotates the page clockwise by 'angle' degrees around point ('x','y'). If the optional
    arguments 'x' and 'y' are omitted, the page will be rotated around its center depending on
    the chosen page format. When option *-bnone* is given, the rotation center is origin (0,0).
  
  *KX* 'angle';;
    Skews the page along the 'x'-axis by 'angle' degrees. Argument 'angle' can take any value
    except 90+180__k__, where 'k' is an integer.
  
  *KY* 'angle';;
    Skews the page along the 'y'-axis by 'angle' degrees. Argument 'angle' can take any value
    except 90+180__k__, where 'k' is an integer.
  
  *FH* ['y'];;
  Mirrors (flips) the page at the horizontal line through point (0,'y'). Omitting the optional argument
  leads to 'y'='h'/2, where 'h' denotes the page height (see 'pre-defined constants' below).
  
  *FV* ['x'];;
  Mirrors (flips) the page at the vertical line through point ('x',0). Omitting the optional argument
  leads to 'x'='w'/2, where 'w' denotes the page width (see 'pre-defined constants' below).
  
  *M* 'm1',...,'m6';;
  Applies a transformation described by the 3&#215;3 matrix
  \(('m1','m2','m3'),('m4','m5','m6'),(0,0,1)), where the inner triples denote
  the rows.
+
[NOTE]
=================================================================================================
All transformation commands of option *-T, --transform* are applied in the order of their appearance.
Multiple commands can optionally be separated by spaces. In this case the whole transformation string
has to be enclosed in double quotes. All parameters are expressions of floating point type. You can either
give plain numbers or arithmetic terms combined by the operators *+* (addition), *-* (subtraction),
*** (multiplication), */* (division) or *%* (modulo) with common associativity and
precedence rules. Parentheses may be used as well.

Additionally, some pre-defined constants are provided:

[horizontal]
*ux*:: horizontal position of upper left page corner in TeX point units
*uy*:: vertical position of upper left page corner in TeX point units
*h*:: page height in TeX point units (0 in case of *-bnone*)
*w*:: page width in TeX point units (0 in case of *-bnone*)

Furthermore, you can use the length constants *pt*, *mm*, *cm* and *in*, e.g.
+2cm+ or +1.6in+. Thus, option +-TT1in,0R45+ moves the page content 1 inch to the right and rotates it
by 45 degrees around the page center afterwards.

For single transformations you can also use options *-c*, *-t* and *-r*. Note that
the order in which these options are given is not significant, i.e. you can't use them to describe
transformation sequences. They are simply independent shorthand options for common transformations.

=================================================================================================
+
//

//
*-v, --verbosity*='level'::
Controls the type of messages printed during a dvisvgm run:
[horizontal]
  *0*;; no message output
  *1*;; error messages only
  *2*;; warning messages only
  *4*;; informational messages only

+
[NOTE]
By adding these values you can combine the categories. The default level is 7, i.e. all
messages are printed.
+


*-V, --version*[='extended']::
Prints the version of dvisvgm and exits. If the optional argument is set to 'yes', the
version numbers of the linked libraries are printed as well.


*-z, --zip*[='level']::
Creates a compressed SVG file with suffix .svgz. The optional argument specifies the compression
level. Valid values are in the range of 1 to 9 (default value is 9). Larger values cause better
compression results but take more computation time.
+
CAUTION: This option cannot be combined with *-s, --stdout*.


SUPPORT OF SPECIALS
-------------------
dvisvgm supports several sets of 'special commands' that can be used to enrich DVI files with additional
features, like color, graphics or hyperlinks. The evaluation of special commands is delegated to various handlers.
Each handler is responsible for all special statements of the same command set, i.e. commands beginning
with the same prefix. To get a list of actually provided special handlers, use option *--list-specials* (see above).

*bgcolor*::
Special statement for changing the background/page color. Since SVG 1.1 doesn't support background colors,
dvisvgm inserts a rectangle of the chosen color. In the current version, this rectangle always gets the size
of the minimal bounding box. This command is part of the color special set but is handled separately in order
to let the user turn it off. For an overview of the command syntax, see the documentation of dvips, for instance.

*color*::
Statements of this command set provide instructions to change the text/paint color. For an overview of the
exact syntax, see the documentation of dvips, for instance.

*dvisvgm*::
dvisvgm offers its own small set of specials. The following list gives a brief overview.
  *dvisvgm:raw* 'text';;
  Adds an arbitrary sequence of characters to the SVG output. dvisvgm does not perform any validation here,
  thus the user has to ensure that the resulting SVG is still valid. Parameter 'text' may
  contain the macros *{?x}*, *{?y}*, and *{?color}* that are expanded to the current 'x' or 'y' coordinate
  and the current color, respectively. Also, macro *{?nl}* expands to a newline character.
 
  *dvisvgm:img* 'width' 'height' 'file';;
  Creates an image element at the current graphic position referencing the given file. JPEG, PNG, and SVG images
  can be used here. However, dvisvgm does not check the file format or the file name suffix. The lengths 'width'
  and 'height' must be given as plain floating point numbers in TeX point units (1in = 72.27pt).
 
  *dvisvgm:bbox* n[ew] 'name';;
  Defines or resets a local bounding box called 'name'. The name may consist of letters and digits.
  While processing a DVI page, dvisvgm continuously updates the (global) bounding box of the current page in order to
  determine the minimal rectangle containing all visible page components (characters, images, drawing elements etc.)
  Additionally to the global bounding box, the user can request an arbitrary number of named local bounding boxes.
  Once defined, these boxes are updated together with the global bounding box starting with the first character that
  follows the definition. Thus, the local boxes can be used to compute the extent of parts of the page. This is useful
  for scenarios where the generated SVG file is post-processed.
  In conjunction with special dvisvgm:raw, the macro *{?bbox 'name'}* expands to the four values 'x', 'y', 'w', and 'h'
  (separated by spaces) specifying the coordinates of the upper left corner, width, and height of the local box 'name'.
  If box 'name' wasn't previously defined, all four values equal zero.
 
  *dvisvgm:bbox* 'width' 'height' ['depth'];;
  Updates the bounding box of the current page by embedding a virtual rectangle ('x', 'y', 'width', 'height')
  where the lower left corner is located at the current DVI drawing position ('x','y'). If the optional parameter 'depth'
  is specified, dvisvgm embeds a second rectangle ('x', 'y', 'width', -__depth__). The lengths 'width', 'height' and
  'depth' must be given as plain floating point numbers in TeX point units (1in = 72.27pt). Depending on size and position
  of the virtual rectangle, this command either enlarges the overall bounding box or leaves it as is. It's not possible
  to reduce its extent. This special should be used in conjunction with *dvisvgm:raw* in order to update the viewport
  of the page properly.
 
  *dvisvgm:bbox* a[bs] 'x1' 'y1' 'x2' 'y2';;
  This variant of the bbox special updates the bounding box by embedding a virtual rectangle ('x1','y1','x2','y2').
  The points ('x1','y1') and ('x2','y2') denote two diagonal corners of the rectangle given in TeX point units.
 
  *dvisvgm:bbox* f[ix] 'x1' 'y1' 'x2' 'y2';;
  This variant of the bbox special assigns an absolute (final) bounding box to the resulting SVG. After executing
  this command, dvisvgm doesn't further alter the bounding box coordinates, except this special is called again later.
  The points ('x1','y1') and ('x2','y2') denote two diagonal corners of the rectangle given in TeX point units.
+
The following TeX snippet adds two raw SVG elements to the output and updates the bounding box accordingly:
+
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\special{dvisvgm:raw <circle cx='{?x}' cy='{?y}' r='10' stroke='black' fill='red'/>}
\special{dvisvgm:bbox 20 10 10}

\special{dvisvgm:raw <path d='M50 200 L10 250 H100 Z' stroke='black' fill='blue'/>}
\special{dvisvgm:bbox abs 10 200 100 250}
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
+

*em*::
These specials were introduced with the emTeX distribution by Eberhard Mattes. They provide line drawing
statements, instructions for embedding MSP, PCX, and BMP image files, as well as two PCL commands.
dvisvgm supports only the line drawing statements and ignores all other em specials silently.
A description of the command syntax can be found in the DVI driver documentation coming with emTeX (see CTAN).

// *html*::
// The hyperref package uses a set of HTML anchor tags to indicate hyperlinks in DVI files.
// dvisvgm converts them to corresponding SVG elements.

*ps*::
The famous DVI driver dvips introduced its own set of specials in order to embed PostScript code into DVI files,
which greatly improves the capabilities of DVI documents. One aim of dvisvgm is to completely evaluate all
PostScript snippets and to convert a large amount of it to SVG. However, in contrast to dvips, dvisvgm uses floating point
arithmetics to compute the precise position of each graphic element, i.e. it doesn't round the corrdinates. Therefore,
the relative locations of the graphic elements may slightly differ from those computed by dvips.
+
Since PostScript is a rather complex language, dvisvgm does not try to implement its own PostScript interpreter but relies on
Ghostscript instead. If the Ghostscript library was not linked while building dvisvgm, it is looked up and dynamically loaded
during runtime. In this case, dvisvgm looks for 'libgs.so' on Unix-like systems, and for 'gsdll32.dll' on Windows.
You can override these default file names with the environment variable +LIBGS+.
The library must be installed and must be reachable through the ld search path (\*nix) or the PATH environment
variable (Windows). If it cannot be found, the evaluation of PostScript specials is disabled.
Use option *--list-specials* to check whether PS support is available, i.e. the entry 'ps' is present.

*tpic*::
The TPIC special set defines instructions for drawing simple geometric objects. Some LaTeX packages, like
eepic and tplot, use these specials to describe graphics.


EXAMPLES
--------
--------------
dvisvgm file
--------------
Converts the first page of 'file.dvi' to 'file.svg'.

---------------
dvisvgm -z file
---------------
Converts the first page of 'file.dvi' to 'file.svgz' with default compression level 9.

-------------------------------------
dvisvgm -p5 -z3 -ba4-l -onewfile file
-------------------------------------
Converts the fifth page of 'file.dvi' to 'newfile.svgz' with compression level 3.
The bounding box is set to DIN/ISO A4 in landscape format.

-----------------------------------------------------
dvisvgm --transform="R20,w/3,2h/5 T1cm,1cm S2,3" file
-----------------------------------------------------
Converts the first page of 'file.dvi' to 'file.svg' where three transformations are applied.


ENVIRONMENT
-----------
dvisvgm uses the *kpathsea* library for locating the files that it opens.
Hence, the environment variables described in the library's documentation influence the converter.

If dvisvgm was linked without the Ghostscript library, and if PostScript support has not been disabled,
the shared Ghostscript library is looked up during runtime via dlopen(). The environment variable +LIBGS+
can be used to specify path and file name of the library.

The pre-compiled Windows version of dvisvgm requires a working installation of MiKTeX 2.9 or above.
To enable evaluation of PostScript specials, the original Ghostscript DLL 'gsdll32.dll' must be present
and reachable through the search path.

The environment variable +DVISVGM_COLORS+ specifies the colors used to highlight various parts of dvisvgm's
message output. It is only evaluated if option *--color* is given. The value of +DVISVGM_COLORS+ is a list of
colon-separated entries of the form 'gg'='BF', where 'gg' denotes one of the color group indicators listed
below, and 'BF' are two hexadecimal digits specifying the background (first digit) and foreground/text color
(second digit). The color color values are defined as follows: 0=black, 1=red, 2=green, 3=yellow, 4=blue,
5=magenta, 6=cyan, 7=gray, 8=bright red, 9=bright green, A=bright yellow, B=bright blue, C=bright magenta,
D=bright cyan, E=bright gray, F=white. Depending on the terminal, the colors may differ. Rather than changing
both the text and background color, it's also possible to change only one of them: An asterisk (*) in
place of a hexadecimal digit indicates the default text or background color of the terminal.

All malformed entries in the list are silently ignored.

[horizontal]
*er*:: error messages
*wn*:: warning messages
*pn*:: messages about page numbers
*ps*:: page size messages
*fw*:: information about the files written
*sm*:: state messages
*tr*:: messages of the glyph tracer
*pi*:: progress indicator

*Example:* +er=01:pi=\*5+ sets the colors of error messages (+er+) to red (+1+) on black (+0+), and those
of progress indicators (+pi+) to cyan (+5+) on default background (+*+).
