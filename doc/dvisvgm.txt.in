NAME
----
dvisvgm - converts DVI files to the XML-based SVG format


SYNOPSIS
--------
*dvisvgm* [ 'options' ] 'file' [.dvi]


DESCRIPTION
-----------
The program *dvisvgm* generates an SVG file from a given DVI file.
DVI is the device independent output format produced by TeX and some other
typesetting systems. Output from groff can be converted to DVI using grodvi.

The recent version of *dvisvgm* provides advanced conversion functionality but currently 
only one page can be converted even if the DVI file is made up of multiple pages. 
You can select the page to be processed with option *-p*. *dvisvgm* should properly convert 
all pages that are made up of fonts and rules only. Additionally, some
sets of specials are understood as well. For a more detailed overview, see
section *support of specials* below.

Since SVG is a vector based graphics format, *dvisvgm* tries to convert the glyph 
outlines of all used fonts into scalable path descriptions. The fastest way to do that 
is to extract the path information from PFB (PostScript Type 1) files. So if *dvisvgm* is able 
to find a PFB file for a used font, it will read the necessary information from it.

Because TeX's main source for font descriptions is Metafont which produces bitmap output, 
not all obtainable TeX fonts are available in PFB format. In these cases *dvisvgm* tries 
to vectorize Metafont's output by tracing the glyph bitmaps. The results are not as perfect 
as most (manually optimized) PFB outlines but are nonetheless really nice in most cases.


OPTIONS
-------
*-a, --trace-all*::
This option forces dvisvgm to trace not just the actually needed glyphs but all 
glyphs of all bitmap fonts used in a DVI file. Since the tracing results are stored in 
the font cache, all following DVI conversions (without option *--trace-all*) where these 
fonts are involved will be much faster. By default, dvisvgm traces only the actually 
needed glyphs and adds them to the cache.
+
[NOTE]
This option only takes affect if font caching is active. Thus, *--trace-all* cannot be 
combined with option *--cache=none*.
+

*-b, --bbox-format*='fmt'::
Sets the bounding box of the generated graphic to the specified format. 
The argument fmt is argument a case-insensitive string that denotes the paper size. 
Following size names are supported:
 
 *International DIN/ISO paper sizes*;;
 A__n__, B__n__, C__n__, D__n__, where 'n' is a non-negative integer, e.g. A4 or a4 for DIN/ISO A4 
 format (210mm &#215; 297mm).
 
 *North American paper sizes*;;
   invoice, executive, legal, letter, ledger
 
 *Special bounding box sizes*;;
   *dvi*:: the page size stored in the DVI file will be used
   *min*:: the minimal bounding box will be computed and assigned
   *none*:: no bounding box will be assigned
 
 *Page orientation*;;
   The default page orientation for DIN/ISO and American paper sizes is 'portrait',
   i.e. 'width' < 'height'. Appending *-landscape* or simply *-l* to the format
   string switches to 'landscape' mode ('width' > 'height'). For symmetry reasons you can 
   also explicitly add *-portrait* or *-p* to indicate the default portrait format.
   Note that these suffixes are part of the size string and not separate options. Thus 
   they must directly follow the above mentioned size specifiers without additional blanks.
   Furthermore, the orientation suffixes can't be used with *dvi*, *min* and *none*.

+
[NOTE]
Option *-b, --bbox-format* only affects the bounding box and doesn't transform the page content. Hence if 
you choose a landscape format the page won't be rotated.
+

*-c, --scale*='sx'[,'sy']::
Scales page content horizontally by 'sx' and vertically by 'sy'. This option is equivalent 
to *-TS*__sx__,__sy__.


*-C, --cache*[='dir']::
To speed up the conversion process of bitmap fonts, *dvisvgm* saves intermediate conversion
information in cache files. By default, these files are stored in $HOME/.dvisvgm. If you prefer 
a different location use option *--cache* to overwrite the default. Furthermore, it is also possible 
to disable the font caching mechanism completely with option *--cache=none*. If argument 'dir' is omitted,
dvisvgm prints the path of the default cache directory and some information about the stored fonts.


*-l, --list-specials*::
Prints a list of registered special handlers and exits. Each handler processes a set of special
statements belonging to the same category. The categories are identified by the
prefix of the special statements. It's usually a leading word
separated from the rest of the statement by a colon or a blank, e.g. 'color' or 'ps'.


*-m, --map-file*='file'::
Sets the map file that is used to look up font names and encodings. *dvisvgm* doesn't provide
its own map file but tries to use available ones coming with *dvips* or *dvipdfm*. If 
option *-m* is not given *dvisvgm* looks for +ps2pk.map+, +dvipdfm.map+, and +psfonts.map+ (in this order).
Without further options, the file specified by option *-m* will be used instead of the 
default maps. If you want *dvisgvm* to load the given file additionally to the default maps, add a 
leading '\+' to the file/path, e.g. `--map-file=\+myfonts.map`.
For further information about the file format see the manuals of *dvips* and *dvipdfm*. 


*-M, --mag*='factor'::
Sets the maginfication factor used for Metafont calls prior tracing the glyphs.
The larger this value the better the tracing results. Nevertheless 
large magnification values can cause Metafont arithmetic errors due to number 
overflows. So use this option with care. The default setting usually produces 
nice results.


*-n, --no-fonts*::
If this option is given, *dvisvgm* doesn't create font elements but uses paths instead. The
resulting SVG file is usually bigger but concurrently more compatible with most applications that
don't support SVG fonts yet. This option implies *--no-styles*.


*-S, --no-specials*[='names']::
Disable processing of special commands that are embedded in the DVI file. If no further
parameter is given, all specials are ignored. To selectively disable sets of specials,
an optional comma-separated list of names can be appended to this option. A 'name' is a unique 
identifier referencing a special handler. Option *--list-specials* lists all currently available 
handlers and their names. 
All unsupported special statements are silently ignored.


*--no-styles*::
By default, *dvisvgm* uses CSS styles and class attributes to reference fonts because it's more
compact than repeatedly set the complete font information in each text element. However, if you 
prefer direct font references, the default behavior can be disabled with option *--no-styles*.


*--no-mktexmf*::
Suppresses the generation of missing font files. If *dvisvgm* can't find a font file
through the kpathsea lookup mechanism, it calls the external tools mktextfm or mktexmf by 
default. This option disables these calls.


*-o, --output*='file'::
Sets the name of the output file.


*-p, --page*='number'::
With this option you can choose the page to be processed. Please consider that the parameter 
of this option don't refer to the page numbers printed on the page. Instead the physical page 
count is expected, where the first page always gets number 1.
If this option is omitted, the first page will be selected.

*-P, --progress*[='skip']::
Enables a simple progress indicator shown when DVI specials are processed,
since this can be a time-consuming operation, especially when PostScript specials are
involved. The optional non-negative parameter 'skip' controls the indicator length:
Every time a set of 'skip' specials has been processed, an indicator character
is printed. Therefore, smaller values lead to a longer, more frequently updated
progress indicator. 

*-r, --rotate*='angle'::
Rotates page content clockwise by 'angle' degrees around the page center.
This option is equivalent to *-TR*'angle'.


*-s, --stdout*::
Don't write output to a file but redirect it to *stdout*.


*-t, --translate*='tx'[,'ty']::
Translates (moves) page content in direction of vector ('tx','ty'). This option is 
equivalent to *-TT*'tx','ty'.


*-T, --transform*='commands'::
Applies a sequence of transformations to the SVG content. Each transformation is described
by a 'command' that begins with a capital letter followed by a list of comma-separated 
parameters. Following transformation commands are supported:
 
  *T* 'tx'[,'ty'];;
    Translates (moves) page in direction of vector ('tx','ty'). If 'ty' is omitted,
    'ty'=0 is assumed.
    The expected unit length of 'tx' and 'ty' are TeX points (1pt = 1/72.27in). However, there 
    are several constants defined to simplify the unit conversion (see below).
  
  *S* 'sx'[,'sy'];;
    Scales page horizontally by 'sx' and vertically by 'sy'. If 'sy' is omitted
    'sy'='sx' is assumed.
  
  *R* 'angle'[,'x','y'];;
    Rotates page clockwise by 'angle' degrees around point ('x','y'). If the optional
    arguments 'x' and 'y' are omitted the page will be rotated around its center depending on
    the chosen page format. When option *-bnone* is given, the rotation center is origin (0,0).
  
  *KX* 'angle';;
    Skews page along the 'x'-axis by 'angle' degrees. Argument 'angle' can take any value
    except 90+180'k', where 'k' is an integer.
  
  *KY* 'angle';;
    Skews page along the 'y'-axis by 'angle' degrees. Argument 'angle' can take any value
    except 90+180'k', where 'k' is an integer.
  
  *FH* ['y'];;
  Mirrors (flips) page at the horizontal line through point (0,'y'). Omitting the optional argument
  leads to 'y'='h'/2, where 'h' denotes the page height (see 'pre-defined constants' below).
  
  *FV* ['x'];;
  Mirrors (flips) page at the vertical line through point ('x',0). Omitting the optional argument
  leads to 'x'='w'/2, where 'w' denotes the page width (see 'pre-defined constants' below).
  
  *M* 'm1',...,'m6';;
  Applies a transformation described by the 3&#215;3 matrix 
  \(('m1','m2','m3'),('m4','m5','m6'),(0,0,1)), where the inner triples denote
  the rows.

+
[NOTE]
=================================================================================================
All transformation commands of option *-T, --transform* are applied in the order of their appearance. Multiple commands can 
optionally be separated by spaces. In this case the whole transformation string has to be enclosed in double 
quotes. All parameters are expressions of floating point type. You can either give plain numbers 
or arithmetic terms combined by the operators *+* (addition), *-* (substraction), 
*** (multiplication), */* (division) or *%* (modulo) with common associativity and 
precedence rules. Parentheses may be used as well.

Additionally, some pre-defined constants are provided:

*ux*:: horizontal position of upper left page corner in TeX point units
*uy*:: vertical position of upper left page corner in TeX point units
*h*:: page height in TeX point units (0 in case of *-bnone*)
*w*:: page width in TeX point units (0 in case of *-bnone*)

Furthermore, you can use the length constants *pt*, *mm*, *cm* and *in*, e.g.
+2cm+ or +1.6in+. Thus, option +-TT1in,0R45+ moves the page content 1 inch to the right and rotates it
by 45 degrees around the page center afterwards.

For single transformations you can also use options *-c*, *-t* and *-r*. Note that 
the order in which these options are given is not significant, i.e. you can't use them to describe
transformation sequences. They are simply independent shorthand options for common transformations. 

=================================================================================================
+

*-v, --verbosity*='level'::
Controls the type of messages printed during a *dvisvgm* run:
  *0*;; no message output
  *1*;; informal output only
  *2*;; warning messages only
  *4*;; error messages only

+
[NOTE]
By adding these values you can combine the categories. The default level is 7, i.e. all 
messages are printed.
+

*-z, --zip*[='level']::
Creates a compressed SVG file with suffix .svgz. The optional argument specifies the compression 
level. Valid values are in the range of 1 to 9 (default is 9). Larger values cause better compression 
results but take more computation time. 
+
CAUTION: This option cannot be combined with *-s, --stdout*.


SUPPORT OF SPECIALS
-------------------
*dvisvgm* supports several sets of special commands that can be used to enrich DVI files with additional 
features, like color, graphics or hyperlinks. The evaluation of special commands is done by various handlers, 
where each handler is responsible for all special statements of the same command set, i.e. commands beginning 
with the same prefix. To get a list of actually provided special handlers, use option *--list-specials* (see above).

*bgcolor*::
Special statement for changing the background/page color. Since SVG 1.1 doesn't support background colors,
*dvisvgm* inserts a rectangle of the chosen color. In the current version, this rectangle always gets the size
of the minimal bounding box.

*color*::
Statements of this command set provide instructions to change the text/paint color. For an overview of the 
exact syntax, see the documentation of *dvips*, for instance.

*dvisvgm*::
*dvisvgm* offers its own small set of specials. The following list gives a brief overview. 
  *dvisvgm:raw* 'text';;
  Embeds an arbitrary sequence of characters into the SVG output. *dvisvgm* does not perform any validation here, 
  thus the user of this special has to ensure that the resulting SVG is still valid. The parameter 'text' may
  contain the macros *{?x}*, *{?y}*, and *{?color}* which are expanded to the current 'x' or 'y' coordinate
  and the current color, respectively.
 
  *dvisvgm:img* 'width' 'height' 'file';;
  Creates an image element at the current graphic position referencing the given file. JPEG, PNG, and SVG images
  can be used here. However, *dvisvgm* doesn't check the file format or the file name suffix. The lengths 'width'
  and 'height' must be given in TeX point units (1in = 72.27pt).
 
  *dvisvgm:bbox* 'width' 'height';;
  Updates the bounding box of the current page by embedding a virtual rectangle of given 'width' and 'height'
  relative to the current DVI drawing position. This command should be used in conjunction with
  *raw* in order to properly update the viewport of the page.

*em*::
These specials were introduced with the emTeX distribution by Eberhard Mattes. They provide line drawing 
statements, instructions for embedding MSP, PCX, and BMP image files, as well as two PCL commands. 
*dvisvgm* supports only the line drawing statements, all other em specials are silently ignored.
A description of the command syntax can be found in the DVI driver documentation coming with emTeX (see CTAN).

// *html*::
// The hyperref package uses a set of HTML anchor tags to indicate hyperlinks in DVI files. 
// *dvisvgm* converts them to corresponding SVG elements.

*ps*::
The famous DVI driver *dvips* introduced its own set of specials in order to embed PostScript code into DVI files,
which greatly improves the capabilities of DVI documents. One aim of *dvisvgm* is to completely evaluate the
PostScript code and to convert a large amount of it to SVG. 
Since PostScript is a rather complex language, *dvisvgm* does not try to implement its own PostScript interpreter but uses 
Ghostscript instead. The Ghostscript shared library (libgs.so on Linux systems, gsdll32.dll on Windows) is loaded dynamically 
during runtime. For this reason, it must be installed and reachable through the PATH environment variable. If the Ghostscript 
library cannot be found, the evaluation of PostScript specials is disabled. Use option *--list-specials* to check whether 
PS support is available, i.e. the entry 'ps' is present.

*tpic*::
The TPIC special set defines instructions for drawing simple geometric objects. Some LaTeX packages, like
eepic and tplot, use these specials to describe graphics. 


EXAMPLES
--------
--------------
dvisvgm file
--------------
Converts first page of 'file.dvi' to 'file.svg'.

---------------
dvisvgm -z file
---------------
Converts first page of 'file.dvi' to 'file.svgz' with default compression level 9.

-------------------------------------
dvisvgm -p5 -z3 -ba4-l -onewfile file
-------------------------------------
Converts fifth page of 'file.dvi' to 'newfile.svgz' with compression level 3.
The bounding box is set to DIN/ISO A4 in landscape format.

-----------------------------------------------------
dvisvgm --transform="R20,w/3,2h/5 T1cm,1cm S2,3" file
-----------------------------------------------------
Converts first page of 'file.dvi' to 'file.svg' where three transformations are applied.


ENVIRONMENT
-----------
*dvisvgm* uses the *kpathsea* library for locating the
files that it opens. Hence, the environment variables described in
the library's documentation influence the converter.

The pre-compiled Windows version of *dvisvgm* requires a working installation of MiKTeX 2.7 or above.
To enable evaluation of PostScript specials, the original Ghostscript DLL must be present. 

FILES
-----
The location of the following files is determined by the kpathsea library.
To check the actual kpathsea configuration you can use the *kpsewhich* utility.

**.enc*:: Font encoding files
**.fgd*:: Font glyph data files (cache files created by dvisvgm)
**.map*:: Font map files
**.mf*::  Metafont input files
**.pfb*:: PostScript Type 1 font files
**.pro*:: PostScript header/prologue files
**.tfm*:: TeX font metric files
**.ttf*:: TrueType font files
**.vf*::  Virtual font files
