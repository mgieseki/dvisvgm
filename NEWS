dvisvgm-0.8.6
- renamed command-line option --bbox-format to --bbox
- option --bbox can now be used to set an arbitrary bounding box
- added the two special variants "dvisvgm:bbox abs" and "dvisvgm:bbox fix"
- fixed a PS bounding box bug
- fixed a couple of PS positioning issues reported by John Bowman

dvisvgm-0.8.5

- updated the man page
- added LGPL license text needed for the gzstream wrapper classes

dvisvgm-0.8.4
- improved the command-line parser to be more POSIX-compliant
- added a simple progress indicator for time-consuming special operations
- option --cache prints more information about the cached fonts
- fixed a clipping bug in the PostScript handler
  (thanks to John Bowman for also providing a patch for this issue)
- fixed a bug in computation of the PS bounding box
- fixed a memory bug in the GF tracer module

dvisvgm-0.8.3
- added basic evaluation of the PostScript "show" operator
  (handles PSTricks Type 3 fonts properly now)
- improved checks for Ghostscript and potrace library in configure script
- external Ghostscript and potrace development files are used if available
- PostScript header/prologue files are now loaded regardless of converted page
- replaced command-line option variant --cache=? by --cache

dvisvgm-0.8.2
- changed license of dvisvgm to GPL version 3 or later
- replaced getopt-based commandline parser by own implementation
  in order to simplify future internationalizations
- fixed memory bug in fontmap reader

dvisvgm-0.8.1
- added evaluation of more psfile parameters
- fixed computation of bounding box in psfile special
- fixed compilation errors and a conversion bug occurred on x64 systems

dvisvgm-0.8
- experimental evaluation of PostScript specials has been added (requires 
  a recent version of the Ghostscript shared library libgs.so or gsdll32.dll)
- several code improvements and refactorings
- fixed compilation bug occurred when using GCC 4.4.x

dvisvgm-0.7.3
- fixed bug in font map reader that could cause a segmentation fault
- fixed bug in creation of shorthand path drawing commands
- fixed bug in TPIC special handler

dvisvgm-0.7.2
- font caching has been added (speeds up embedding of bitmap fonts)
- added option --trace-all that enables tracing of all glyphs of all
  bitmap fonts used in the currect DVI file. Even glyphs that are currently
  not needed are considered. This avoids multiple calls of Metafont for the 
  same fonts. In combination with the new caching functionality this can 
  drastically increase the speed of successive dvisvgm calls.
- if option --no-fonts is used, all glyph sizes are now computed correctly
- use shorthand path commands in SVG fonts if possible

dvisvgm-0.7.1
- evaluation of a subset of emTeX specials has been added
- specials for embedding of raw SVG snippets have been added
- evaluation of TPIC specials has been added
- added background color support
- added option -n, --no-fonts that replaces fonts by paths
  (enables applications w/o SVG font support to render dvisvgm's output properly)
- moved defs to top of SVG file to make Firefox's SVG renderer happy
- fixed bug in color handler

dvisvgm-0.7
- basic support for evaluation of specials has been added
- evaluation of color specials has been added
- renamed command-line option -S to --no-specials and inverted previous behavior
- selected special sets can be disabled by optional arguments to --no-specials
  (currently only color specials)
- added option --no-style (see manpage for further details)
- added optional '+' flag to option --map-file (see manpage for further details)
- fixed \magnificaton bug (dvi magnification factor is now applied properly)
- fixed buggy call of maketfm/makemf in Windows/MiKTeX version
- fixed buggy evaluation of command-line argument -m/--map-file
- several internal code improvements

dvisvgm-0.6.1
- added support for dvips map files
- removed dependency on dvipdfm's map file (now ps2pk.map, psfonts.map or dvipdfm.map is used by default)
- fixed compilation bug #2535497
- some internal refactorings

dvisvgm-0.6
- added support for varying font encodings
- updated MiKTeX support using its COM interface
- fixed incomplete handling of nested virtual fonts
- fixed a font handling bug that could cause segmentation faults
- fixed bug in matrix transformation code
- updated bundled potrace library to version 1.8

dvisvgm-0.5
- redesigned and improved font handling
- added support for virtual fonts
- evaluation of dvipdfm's map file to find font files with differing 
  names (e.g. cork-lmr10 => lmr10)
- automatic invocation of mktexmf etc. in case of missing font files (tfm, mf)
- command-line option -m has been renamed to -M
- added command-line options -m/--map-file and -n/--no-mktexmf
- memory bug in StreamCounter class has been fixed
- added sources of Peter Selinger's potrace library (part of potrace, http://potrace.sourceforge.net)
